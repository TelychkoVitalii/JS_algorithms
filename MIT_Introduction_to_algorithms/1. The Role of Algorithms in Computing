1. An algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes
some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as
output. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the
input into the output. The algorithm describes a specific computational procedure for achieving that input/output relationship.
